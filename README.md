# Environmental AI Healthcare System

## Project Overview
The **Environmental AI Healthcare System** is a Flask-based AI application that analyzes environmental scene images and generates health-risk guidance for users. It addresses a real problem in preventive healthcare: people often observe unsafe environmental conditions (such as stagnant water or polluted areas) but lack immediate, contextual health advice.

The system combines:
- **Computer Vision** using an EfficientNet CNN to classify environmental conditions from uploaded or captured images
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using FAISS + SentenceTransformers + LLaMA 3.2 (via Ollama) to generate grounded, context-aware advisories

This architecture delivers both a predicted environmental class and practical healthcare recommendations in an interactive web interface, with downloadable PDF reporting.

The about page provides an overview of the project, its motivation, system architecture, and the technologies used to build the platform.


## System Architecture
The platform follows a pipeline architecture:

1. **Input Layer**: Image upload or camera capture from the report interface
2. **Vision Layer**: EfficientNet CNN performs environmental class prediction
3. **Retrieval Layer**: FAISS searches relevant health knowledge using SentenceTransformers embeddings
4. **Generation Layer**: LLaMA 3.2 (via Ollama) generates structured, context-grounded health advisories
5. **Application Layer**: Flask APIs serve analysis, follow-up Q&A, and frontend interactions
6. **Reporting Layer**: ReportLab compiles predictions and advisories into downloadable PDF reports

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Ollama installed locally
- LLaMA 3.2 model pulled in Ollama

### Setup Steps
1. Clone the repository and enter the project directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/logitechsoumili/Environmental_AI_Healthcare_System.git
cd Environmental_AI_Healthcare_System
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
```bash
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Pull the Ollama model (first-time setup):
```bash
ollama pull llama3.2:1b
```

## Run Locally
1. Ensure Ollama is running locally (separate terminal):
```bash
ollama run llama3.2:1b
```

2. Start the Flask application:
```bash
cd backend
python app.py
```

3. Open your browser:
```text
http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

## Usage
1. Upload an environmental image or capture one using the device camera.
2. Click **Analyze Environment**.
3. View the predicted environmental class and confidence score.
4. Review the AI-generated advisory (possible diseases, preventive measures, and health guidelines).
5. Download the generated PDF report.

## Future Work
- Real-time environmental monitoring with sensor and streaming integrations
- Waste type classification for more granular sanitation risk detection
- Air pollution subtype detection (e.g., smoke, dust, industrial emissions)
- Geolocation-based public health alerts
- Multilingual health advisories for broader accessibility
- Grad-CAM explainability overlays for CNN prediction transparency

## Academic Relevance
This project demonstrates a multidisciplinary AI workflow spanning computer vision, information retrieval, and large language model inference for healthcare-oriented environmental decision support.
